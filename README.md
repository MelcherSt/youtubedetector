## Background 
 
 ### adudump
 YouTube Detector is meant to be used together with the *adudump* tool created by Dr. Jeff Terrell. Adudump is able to infer
 Application Data Unit (ADU) sizes from TCP segments. Ytdetector has a real-time mode in which adudump output can be 
 piped through to the detector for immediate detection.
 
 ### HTTP Arhive (HAR)
 HAR files are used as input to create fingerprints. 
 An HAR can easily be created using any modern browsers' developer tools suite. No HAR files are included in this repository.
 
 ### Video definition
 `videos.txt` contains a definition of the 20 most viewed YouTube videos. These videos are used as part of the research project. 
 Part of the definition includes the video's HAR file.
 
## Algorithm
The algorithm uses HTTP request sizes and their respective order to detect which video is playing. 
It is loosely based on the idea of state machines - NFAs to be precisely.
